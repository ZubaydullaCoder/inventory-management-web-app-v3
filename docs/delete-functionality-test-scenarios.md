2. Confirm deletion in dialog
3. **Expected Results:**
   - âœ… Dialog closes immediately
   - âœ… Product disappears from table instantly (optimistic update)
   - âœ… Toast shows "Deleting product..." with loading spinner
   - âœ… After server response: toast shows specific error message

### Test Scenario 4: Cancel Delete

3. **Expected Results:**
   - âœ… Dialog closes
   - âœ… No changes to table
   - âœ… No toast notifications
   - âœ… Product remains in table

### Test Scenario 5: Multiple Products
**Steps:**
1. Delete multiple products in sequence
2. **Expected Results:**
   - âœ… Each product disappears instantly when confirmed
   - âœ… Multiple toast notifications can appear simultaneously
   - âœ… Each toast updates independently based on server response
   - âœ… Table updates reflect all changes correctly

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Optimistic Updates Flow
```
User Confirms Delete
    â†“
Dialog Closes + Loading Toast Appears
    â†“
Product Removed from Cache (Optimistic)
    â†“
Table Re-renders (Product Gone)
    â†“
Server Request Sent
    â†“
Success: Toast â†’ Success, Cache Stays Updated
    OR
Error: Toast â†’ Error, Cache Rollback, Product Returns
```

### Toast State Management
- **Loading State**: `toast.loading("Deleting product...")`
- **Success State**: `toast.success("Product deleted successfully!", { id: toastId })`
- **Error State**: `toast.error(errorMessage, { id: toastId })`

### Cache Management
- **Optimistic Update**: Product filtered out of all cached lists
- **Success**: Cache invalidation for fresh server data
- **Error**: Cache rollback to previous state

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Goals

1. **Instant Feedback**: Users see changes immediately
2. **Clear Communication**: Toast messages indicate current state
3. **Error Recovery**: Failed operations restore previous state
4. **Smooth Interactions**: No UI freezing or jarring transitions
5. **Safety**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidents
