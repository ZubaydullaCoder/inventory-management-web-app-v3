That is an excellent and highly relevant question. It cuts directly to the core of the DRY principle and strategic coding.

Here is a detailed breakdown to answer your question:

### **Direct Answer**

No, based on my analysis of the current codebase, **offset pagination is not actively used anywhere.**

The primary component responsible for this, `ProductDisplayList`, has a prop `useCursorPagination` which defaults to `true`. In its only current usage on the main products page, this prop is not overridden, meaning the application is exclusively using the cursor-based implementation.

Therefore, **yes, you can and probably should remove the offset pagination code.**

### **Analysis: The Strategic Rationale (Why Both Might Exist)**

A senior developer would intentionally build this kind of strategic switch for a few key reasons. It's important to understand the original intent before removing the code.

1.  **Performance vs. Functionality Trade-off:**

    - **Cursor Pagination (What you are using):** Is extremely performant for large datasets. It avoids slow database `OFFSET` operations and is ideal for "infinite scroll" or simple "Next/Previous" navigation. Its main limitation is that you **cannot jump to a specific page** (e.g., "Go to Page 5 of 20").
    - **Offset Pagination (The unused code):** Is less performant on very large datasets in a database but provides the classic pagination experience. It allows users to see the total number of pages and jump directly to any of them.

2.  **Future-Proofing:** The developer who wrote this likely anticipated that while the main product list benefits from the performance of cursor pagination, another feature in the future might _require_ the ability to jump to specific pages. For example:

    - A "Sales History" report where a user wants to see records from page 10.
    - An audit log.
    - Any context where the user might say, "I remember seeing that item around page 3."

3.  **A/B Testing or UX Flexibility:** The developer might have built both to test which one provided a better user experience before committing to one, leaving the unused code behind.

### **Recommendation: To Remove or Not to Remove?**

You have two clear paths forward, both of which are valid depending on your project's long-term goals.

#### **Option 1: Remove Offset Pagination (The Pragmatic, Clean Code Approach)**

This involves removing `useTableUrlState`, `useGetProducts`, and the conditional logic within `ProductDisplayList`.

- **Pros:**

  - **Immediate Simplification:** Your codebase becomes significantly smaller, cleaner, and easier to understand.
  - **Adheres to YAGNI ("You Ain't Gonna Need It"):** This is a core software development principle. It advises against adding functionality based on future speculation. You remove the code that isn't providing value right now.
  - **Single Source of Truth:** You are left with one clear, unambiguous way of handling product data fetching and state management, which is a huge win for maintainability.

- **Cons:**
  - **Reduced Flexibility:** If you discover in a later phase that you _do_ need to jump to a specific page, you will have to re-write the offset pagination logic from scratch.

#### **Option 2: Keep Both and Refactor (The Flexible, Architectural Approach)**

This involves keeping the functionality but addressing the severe code duplication as identified in our previous review by merging the two state management hooks.

- **Pros:**

  - **Maximum Flexibility:** You retain the ability to use the best pagination strategy for any given context. You could have a cursor on the main products page and offset on a future reports page, all managed by a single, elegant hook.
  - **Future-Proofs the Application:** You are prepared for future requirements without needing to re-architect a core part of your data display system.

- **Cons:**
  - **Higher Upfront Effort:** This requires the refactoring work of merging the hooks.
  - **Slightly Higher Complexity:** The final unified hook will be inherently more complex than a hook that only handles one pagination mode.

### **Final Recommendation**

Given the project's current scope as an MVP and the significant immediate benefits of simplification, **I recommend Option 1: Remove the offset pagination code.**

The principle of YAGNI is very powerful. The cost of maintaining and reasoning about the unused offset code is real and immediate, whereas the need for it in the future is speculative. Removing it will make your codebase leaner and more focused. If the need for offset pagination arises later, it can be added back as a new, distinct feature requirement.

This approach provides the most value by reducing complexity right now.
