Step 1 — Intent Clarification & Request Evaluation

You want the “Category” dropdown in the product-creation form to behave like the “Unit” field: after you submit and the form resets, the last-picked category remains selected (instead of clearing back to blank).
This is a clear, actionable request—no further detail needed.
Step 2 — What Do We Implement?
Before:

User picks Category → submits → form resets → Category field always reverts to empty.
After:

User picks Category “Gardening Tools” → submits → form resets → Category still set to “Gardening Tools.”
This improves usability when adding many products in the same category.
Edge cases & decisions:

If user changes category mid-form, update the “last chosen” value.
If user never picks a category, it stays blank.
Resetting should still clear all other fields (name, price, etc.) but preserve category (and unit).
Step 3 — How Do We Implement?

Locate useProductCreationForm in use-product-creation-form.js.
Mirror the existing “unit” preservation logic:
Add a const [lastCategory, setLastCategory] = useState(initialValues.categoryId) state.
const categoryId = watch("categoryId"), then in an effect useEffect(() => setLastCategory(categoryId), [categoryId]).
In the submission handler (onSubmit), after you call reset(...), supply { …initialValues, unit: lastUnit, categoryId: lastCategory } instead of only preserving unit.
No new packages needed—reuses React state and react-hook-form’s watch + reset.
Step 4 — Final Plan Summary

📁 File to update
use-product-creation-form.js
🔄 Reused logic
Copy/paste the “unit” preservation snippet, adjusting field names from unit → categoryId and lastUnit → lastCategory.
