Step 1 ‚Äî Intent Clarification & Request Evaluation
User Intent Analysis: The user wants to reorganize the product creation form layout to improve the visual grouping and user experience. Specifically:

Initial Stock and Reorder Point should be on the same row (currently they're separated)
Unit of Measure, Category, and Supplier should each take full width (single column) like the Product Name field
This creates better logical grouping and visual hierarchy
Clarity & Completeness: The request is clear and actionable. The user wants to move from a primarily two-column grid layout to a mixed layout that emphasizes field relationships and reduces visual clutter.

Step 2 ‚Äî What Do We Implement?
Current Behavior:

Product Name: Full width (good)
Selling/Purchase Price: Two columns (appropriate)
Initial Stock/Unit of Measure: Two columns (confusing pairing)
Reorder Point: Two columns with empty space (wasteful)
Category/Supplier: Two columns (cramped for complex inputs)
Expected Behavior After Implementation:

Product Name: Full width (unchanged)
Selling/Purchase Price: Two columns (unchanged - related pricing fields)
Initial Stock/Reorder Point: Two columns (logical inventory quantity pairing)
Unit of Measure: Full width (standalone field with better visibility)
Category: Full width (CreatableSelect needs space for dropdown and search)
Supplier: Full width (consistent with other standalone fields)
Benefits:

Better field grouping (inventory quantities together)
More space for complex inputs (Category CreatableSelect, Unit dropdown)
Improved visual hierarchy and scanning
Consistent single-column treatment for metadata fields
No wasted empty grid spaces
Step 3 ‚Äî How Do We Implement?
Current Project Analysis:

The form uses Tailwind CSS grid utilities (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4)
Form structure is clean with clear field groupings
Components are well-modularized (NumberField, UnitSelectField, CategoryCreatableSelect)
Current layout logic is straightforward to modify
Implementation Approach:

Reorganize Grid Sections: Modify the existing grid containers to reflect new field groupings
Maintain Responsive Design: Keep md:grid-cols-2 for two-column fields, use single column for standalone fields
Preserve Field Components: No changes needed to individual field components
Keep Current Spacing: Maintain space-y-6 for section spacing and gap-4 for grid gaps
Technical Changes Needed:

Move reorderPoint from its own grid section to pair with stock
Move unit from pairing with stock to its own full-width section
Move categoryId and supplierId to individual full-width sections
Remove the empty <div /> placeholder that was balancing the reorder point
Layout Strategy:

Section 1: Product Name (full width) ‚úì unchanged
Section 2: Selling Price + Purchase Price (two columns) ‚úì unchanged
Section 3: Initial Stock + Reorder Point (two columns) ‚úì new grouping
Section 4: Unit of Measure (full width) ‚úì new standalone
Section 5: Category (full width) ‚úì new standalone
Section 6: Supplier (full width) ‚úì new standalone
Step 4 ‚Äî Final Plan Summary
üìÅ Files to be Updated:

product-creation-form.jsx - Reorganize form layout sections
üì¶ Existing Dependencies Leveraged:

Tailwind CSS grid utilities (no additional packages needed)
Existing form components (NumberField, UnitSelectField, CategoryCreatableSelect)
Current responsive design patterns (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2)
üîÑ Reused Components/Logic:

All existing field components remain unchanged
Current form validation and submission logic preserved
Existing spacing and styling patterns maintained
Specific Changes:

Combine Initial Stock + Reorder Point in one two-column grid section
Convert Unit of Measure to full-width standalone section
Convert Category to full-width standalone section
Convert Supplier to full-width standalone section
Remove empty <div /> placeholder element
‚è≥ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Layout reorganization implemented successfully.

The implementation has been completed and tested:

- Initial Stock and Reorder Point are now paired in the same row
- Unit of Measure is now a full-width standalone field
- Category is now a full-width standalone field (with CreatableSelect functionality)
- Supplier is now a full-width standalone field
- Removed the empty `<div />` placeholder
- Both product creation and edit forms maintain consistent layout
- No compilation errors and server running successfully

The new layout provides better logical field grouping and improved user experience.
