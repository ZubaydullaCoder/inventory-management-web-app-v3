1. Duplicate Product Name Validation & Input Normalization
   Normalization Utility:
   We created and refined a single, reusable normalizeProductName function in utils.js that:

Trims leading/trailing whitespace.
Collapses all internal whitespace (including Unicode separators) to a single space.
Converts the string to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
This ensures that product names like "Product 1", " product 1 ", and "PRODUCT 1" (with non-breaking space) are all treated as the same.
Integration:

The normalization is used:
In the Zod schema for server/client validation.
In the product name uniqueness check (debounced and normalized before querying).
In the API/data layer for duplicate checks.
This guarantees consistent, DRY, and robust duplicate detection across all layers. 2. Efficient, Debounced Duplicate Name Checking
Debounced Validation:

The product name input is watched and normalized.
The normalized value is debounced (using use-debounce) before triggering the uniqueness check, reducing unnecessary API calls.
TanStack Query Integration:

The useCheckProductName hook uses the normalized, debounced name as its query key.
We set refetchOnMount: true and use isFetching (not just isLoading) to ensure the check always runs when the normalized value changes, even if the value was previously checked.
This fixes the bug where removing or adding spaces (or other meaningful changes) would not always trigger a new check. 3. Form State Management & UI Separation
Encapsulated State Logic:

All form state and business logic is encapsulated in a custom hook useProductCreationForm.
The form component (ProductCreationForm) is now purely presentational, receiving all state and handlers as props from the hook.
Presentational Field Components:

The product name field (ProductNameField) is a presentational component, receiving isCheckingName, isNameDuplicate, and nameCheckError as props.
The submit button is disabled if:
The name is being checked (isFetching).
The name is a duplicate.
The form is submitting. 4. Optimistic UI & Cache Management
Optimistic Updates:
When a product is created, it is optimistically added to the session list and the TanStack Query cache.
If the mutation fails, the optimistic entry is rolled back.
On success, the cache is invalidated and refetched to ensure consistency. 5. Best Practices & Scalability
Reusable Normalization:
The normalization utility is generic and can be reused for other forms (e.g., categories, suppliers) in the future.
Unicode & Case Handling:
The normalization is Unicode-aware and case-insensitive, making the system robust for international and multi-lingual input.
Separation of Concerns:
Business logic, data fetching, and UI are cleanly separated for maintainability and scalability.
Naming Conventions:
We discussed and applied more specific file/component naming for clarity (e.g., product-creation-form.jsx, product-name-field.jsx). 6. Bug Fixes & Edge Cases
Validation Always Runs on Meaningful Change:
The duplicate check now always runs when the normalized value changes, fixing the bug where removing spaces or making other meaningful changes would not trigger validation.
Submit Button State:
The submit button is always disabled during duplicate checking or when a duplicate is detected, preventing accidental submissions. 7. Summary Table of Key Files Updated/Created
File/Component Purpose/Change
utils.js Robust, reusable normalization utility
use-product-creation-form.js Encapsulated form state, validation, and submission logic
product-creation-form.jsx Presentational form, receives all logic via props
product-name-field.jsx Presentational name input with validation feedback
use-product-queries.js TanStack Query hooks, with refetchOnMount and isFetching for validation
In summary:
You now have a robust, scalable, and maintainable product creation flow that follows modern React/Next.js best practices, is DRY, and is ready for future extension to other resource types.
