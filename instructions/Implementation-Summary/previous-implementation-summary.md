Here’s a summary of what we implemented and planned in this chat thread:

1. Edit Product Modal & Name Validation UX
   Ensured that name validation feedback (spinner, duplicate, available, error) only appears when the user actually changes the product name, not on initial modal open or when closing the modal.
   Prevented flickering of validation messages when submitting or closing the modal by gating feedback on formState.isSubmitting.
   Used React Hook Form’s dirtyFields.name to track if the user has interacted with the name field, ensuring validation only runs after user input.
2. Duplicate Name Check & Cache Consistency
   Fixed a bug where editing a product’s name (e.g., "product 1" → "product1" → "product 1") could cause false duplicate errors in the creation form due to stale cache.
   Enhanced the cache invalidation strategy: when a product is edited, both the old and new normalized names’ duplicate-check cache entries are invalidated, ensuring the creation form always gets up-to-date results.
3. Session List & Creation Form Integration
   Ensured that when editing a product in the session list, the duplicate check API receives an excludeId so the product’s own name is never considered a duplicate.
   Applied the same excludeId logic to the creation form when editing in-session (optimistic) products, preventing false positives for names that have just been changed in the current session.
4. General Best Practices
   Used TanStack Query’s enabled option and precise query keys to control when validation queries run.
   Kept presentational components (like ProductNameField) dumb, with all logic and state management in hooks and parent components.
   Maintained a clean, declarative, and maintainable codebase by leveraging React Hook Form and TanStack Query best practices.
   Result:
   The product creation and edit flows now provide a robust, flicker-free, and accurate name validation experience, with cache and UI always in sync—eliminating false duplicate errors and improving user experience.
