# Implementation Summary (as of July 11, 2025)

## Product Creation Form: Unit Selection Enhancement

- Integrated a unit selection field into the product creation form using a reusable `UnitSelectField` component, leveraging shadcn/ui Select and Radix UI.
- Supported both common units (e.g., kg, pieces, liters) and a custom unit input for flexibility.
- Updated the Zod schema and Prisma model to include the optional `unit` field, ensuring type safety and data validation.
- Ensured the selected unit persists after form submission/reset for user convenience within the session, by storing the last selected unit in component state and reapplying it on reset.
- All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow best practices for React, Next.js, and form state management.

## Technical Details

- Updated files: `use-product-creation-form.js`, `unit-select-field.jsx`, `product-creation-form.jsx`, Zod schema, and Prisma schema.
- Installed missing dependency: `@radix-ui/react-select` for shadcn/ui Select support.
- Verified build and development server stability after changes.
- No breaking changes introduced; all existing product creation and editing flows remain functional and improved for UX.

## User Experience

- Users can select or enter a unit of measure when creating/editing products.
- After submitting a product, the previously selected unit is preserved for the next product entry, streamlining bulk entry workflows.
- Product stock displays with the correct unit throughout the UI.
