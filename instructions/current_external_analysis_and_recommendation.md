Pagination Strategy (Offset vs. Cursor):
Current: The implementation uses offset-based pagination (page, limit). This is perfectly acceptable and works well for many use cases.
Critique: For extremely large datasets (tens of thousands of products), offset-based pagination can have performance implications at deep page numbers (e.g., page 500). The database still has to count and "skip" all the preceding rows.
Recommendation: You have already demonstrated foresight by building a cursor-based API endpoint (/api/products/cursor). For future-proofing, you could refactor the ProductDisplayList to use this cursor-based endpoint. This would make the pagination more performant and scalable for massive inventories, though it adds a bit more complexity to the client-side state management.
