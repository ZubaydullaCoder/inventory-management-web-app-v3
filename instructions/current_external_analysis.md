You have made an excellent and precise observation. Your analysis is correct: the architectural guides specify a three-layer backend structure that includes a `/lib/services` directory for complex, multi-model business logic, but this directory does not currently exist.

After a thorough audit of the `lib/api` and `lib/data` directories against your project's guiding principles, I can confirm that the structure is **largely correct and well-implemented, but with one notable architectural deviation** that should be addressed for consistency and long-term maintainability.

### Overall Assessment

First, the core principle of separating the API layer from the data logic layer is being followed correctly:

- **`src/app/api/**/\*.js`(API Layer):** These files correctly function as the "front door." They handle HTTP requests, perform authentication checks with`await auth()`, validate payloads with Zod schemas, and then delegate the core database work to functions imported from `/lib/data`. They do not contain direct Prisma queries, which adheres perfectly to your design system.
- **`src/lib/data/{products.js, categories.js}` (Data Layer):** These files are excellent examples of the Data Layer. Their functions (`createProduct`, `getProductsByShopId`, `updateCategory`, etc.) perform direct, single-model CRUD operations using Prisma.

This structure correctly isolates concerns and is well-executed.

### Architectural Review Finding

Here is the specific finding regarding the deviation:

**[SEVERITY]:** Medium

**[ISSUE & CONTEXT]:** Architectural Deviation: Service-Level Logic in Data Layer.

The function `upsertUserAndCreateShop` located in `src/lib/data/users.js` performs a multi-model atomic transaction. It interacts with the `User`, `Shop`, and `Subscription` models within a single `prisma.$transaction()` block.

**[REASONING & RECOMMENDATION]:**
According to your **Guide 13: Backend Design System**, this type of operation is the explicit responsibility of the **Service Layer (`/lib/services`)**, not the Data Layer.

- **Reasoning:** The primary principle of this architecture is Separation of Concerns.

  - The **Data Layer**'s responsibility is to provide simple, reusable functions for interacting with a _single_ data model (e.g., `findUser`, `createShop`).
  - The **Service Layer**'s responsibility is to _orchestrate_ calls to the Data Layer and manage complex operations or transactions that span _multiple_ models (e.g., creating a user _and_ their shop _and_ a subscription).

  Placing the `upsertUserAndCreateShop` function in `/lib/data` blurs these boundaries. It gives the Data Layer a responsibility that it is not supposed to have, which can lead to confusion for future development and maintenance. A developer looking for complex business logic would not instinctively look in the `/lib/data` directory.

- **Recommendation:** To align the codebase perfectly with its documented architecture, I recommend the following refactoring:

  1.  **Create the missing Service Layer directory:**

      ```bash
      src/lib/services/
      ```

  2.  **Create a dedicated service file for user-related business logic:**

      ```bash
      src/lib/services/user-service.js
      ```

  3.  **Move the `upsertUserAndCreateShop` function** from `src/lib/data/users.js` into the new `src/lib/services/user-service.js`. The `src/lib/data/users.js` file might become empty and could be removed if no other single-model user functions are needed.

  4.  **Update the import path** in the file that consumes this function (which is `src/lib/auth.config.js`):

      ```javascript
      // In: src/lib/auth.config.js

      // FROM:
      import { upsertUserAndCreateShop } from "./data/users";

      // TO:
      import { upsertUserAndCreateShop } from "./services/user-service";
      ```

### Conclusion

The project's backend structure is solid and demonstrates a strong adherence to its architectural principles. This single deviation is minor and easily corrected. By performing the recommended refactoring, you will bring the codebase into full alignment with your excellent design documents, enhancing its clarity and long-term maintainability.
