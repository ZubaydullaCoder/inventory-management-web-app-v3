Excellent request. You've correctly identified that pagination is a critical area for performance. Let's conduct a thorough review of the current implementation.

### Step 1 — Intent Clarification & Request Evaluation

Your request is clear, actionable, and highly relevant. You want to ensure the product table's pagination is implemented correctly and efficiently, adhering to performance best practices.

My evaluation confirms that while the **current pagination system is functional, it does not use the most performant strategy available for large datasets.** The codebase already contains a more advanced, scalable solution that is not yet being utilized by the user interface. My plan will focus on activating this superior implementation.

### Step 2 — What Do We Implement?

**Current Behavior:**
The product table currently uses **offset-based pagination**. The UI displays page numbers (1, 2, 3...), a "Rows per page" selector, and buttons to jump to the first or last page. When a user clicks on page "50", the application asks the database to "skip the first 490 products and give me the next 10". This works well for a few hundred products, but for a shop with thousands of items, asking the database to count and skip tens of thousands of rows every time a user changes pages becomes increasingly slow and inefficient.
