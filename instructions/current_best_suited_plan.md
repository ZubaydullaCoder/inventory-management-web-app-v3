Step 1 — Intent Clarification
You want to fix the “Edit Product” modal so that when you open it from the main product table:

The Category dropdown shows the product’s current category instead of “Category (optional)”.
The Reorder Point input displays the actual number on the product (not always 0).
This is clear, actionable, and scoped to the edit‐modal workflow in the product table.

Step 2 — What We’ll Implement
Before:

The table fetcher omits both categoryId and reorderPoint from the JSON it returns.
The edit hook’s reset({...}) call uses product.categoryId and product.reorderPoint, but those fields are always undefined.
As a result the form falls back to placeholder values (“Category (optional)”, “0”), even when the product has real data.
After:

We’ll add categoryId: true and reorderPoint: true to the Prisma select in both getProductsByShopId and getProductsByShopIdCursor.
Now the GET endpoints return those fields, the edit hook’s reset will see real values, and both the dropdown and numeric input will pre-populate correctly.
Edge cases:

Products without a category still show “optional”
Products with no reorder point show an empty input instead of zero
Step 3 — How We’ll Implement

Locate products.js.
In getProductsByShopId(...)
Find the selectFields object passed to prisma.product.findMany.
Add
In getProductsByShopIdCursor(...)
Likewise add the same two lines to its selectFields.
No changes needed in front-end hooks or components—they’ll automatically pick up the new fields.
This reuses your existing Prisma setup, keeps things DRY, and fixes the root cause.

Step 4 — Final Plan Summary

📁 Files to update
products.js
getProductsByShopId: add reorderPoint and categoryId to selectFields
getProductsByShopIdCursor: add the same two fields
📦 No new dependencies
💻 CLI: none
🔄 Reuses existing Prisma client and edit-form logic
