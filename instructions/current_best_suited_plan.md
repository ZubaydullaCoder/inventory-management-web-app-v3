Step 1 — Intent Clarification & Request Evaluation

Your report is clear and actionable: after integrating cursor pagination, the product‐name and category filters no longer work—typing any filter still shows “no results,” even when matching items exist.

Step 2 — What Do We Implement?

• Current Behavior
– Cursor API is called with nameFilter & categoryFilter from local state
– Server returns zero items, “no results” message displayed

• Target Behavior
– When typing into the product‐name or category filter inputs:
• The table updates to show only matching products
• Cursor is reset (to start of filtered set)
• Next/Previous navigation works over the filtered subset

Edge Cases / Scenarios
• Empty filter → full list, working cursor nav
• New filter input resets cursor
• Clearing filter resets cursor and shows unfiltered list
• Filtering plus paging: e.g. filter for “chair,” navigate pages of chairs

Step 3 — How Do We Implement?

Root Cause Hypothesis
The cursor‐pagination data‐layer (Prisma/route) is not applying the nameFilter/categoryFilter arguments, so the API always returns zero items for any filter. Under offset pagination the same server code handled filters correctly; the cursor route needs to incorporate those where‐clauses.

Investigation Steps

Confirm in products.js that getProductsByShopIdCursor() uses the filter parameters in its Prisma query.
If missing, add where clauses for name and category.name filters, matching the existing offset‐query logic.
Ensure the route handler in route.js passes nameFilter & categoryFilter into the data‐layer function.
Reuse & Consistency
– Copy filter‐building logic from the offset‐pagination path (in getProductsByShopId or similar).
– No new packages needed—reusing Prisma and existing query patterns.

Step 4 — Final Plan Summary

• Files to Update
– route.js
– products.js

• Key API Properties
– Ensure nameFilter and categoryFilter are forwarded from route → data layer
– In Prisma query, add:
• where: { name: { contains: nameFilter, mode: 'insensitive' }, category: { name: { contains: categoryFilter, mode: 'insensitive' } } }

• CLI Commands
– none

• Reused Logic
– The where‐filters from getProductsByShopId() (offset) in products.js
