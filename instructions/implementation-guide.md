Step 1 ‚Äî Intent Clarification & Request Evaluation
User Intent Analysis: The user wants to implement a "CreatableSelect" component for category selection in the product creation/edit forms. This component should:

Display existing categories in a searchable dropdown
Allow users to type and filter categories
Show a "Create [typed value]" option when no exact match exists
Create the category immediately via mutation when selected
Select the newly created category in the form
Provide instant feedback
Clarity & Completeness: The request is clear and actionable. The user has provided a specific UX flow with decision points and expected behavior. This aligns with the PRD requirements for category management and the technical patterns already established in the codebase.

Step 2 ‚Äî What Do We Implement?
Current Behavior:

Product creation/edit forms have a simple text input for "categoryId"
No category management or creation functionality exists
Users must manually enter category IDs (poor UX)
Expected Behavior After Implementation:

Category Selection Field: Replace the current text input with a sophisticated CreatableSelect component
Search & Filter: Users can click the dropdown to see all existing categories and type to filter them
Dynamic Create Option: When typing "Gardening Tool" (no exact match), a clearly marked "[+] Create 'Gardening Tool'" option appears at the top
Immediate Creation: Selecting the create option instantly creates the category via API and selects it
Form Integration: The newly created category ID is set in the form field
Optimistic Updates: The category list updates optimistically for instant feedback
Error Handling: Failed category creation shows appropriate error messages
Accessibility: Full keyboard navigation and proper ARIA labels
Edge Cases Covered:

Empty category list (first category creation)
Duplicate category names (prevented by normalization)
Network failures during creation
Clearing/changing selection after creation
Step 3 ‚Äî How Do We Implement?
Current Project Analysis:

Uses shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
TanStack Query for state management with optimistic updates
Three-layer backend architecture (API ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Data)
Prisma with PostgreSQL for data persistence
Form handling with react-hook-form and Zod validation
Integration Points:

product-creation-form.jsx and product-edit-modal.jsx currently use simple Input for categoryId
Need to create category CRUD infrastructure (currently missing)
Must follow established patterns from product implementation
Reusable Components & Patterns:

shadcn/ui Command and Popover components (as specified in guide-12)
Existing optimistic update patterns from use-product-queries.js
API route structure from route.js
Data layer functions from products.js
Zod schema patterns from zod-schemas.js
Technical Approach Selection:

CreatableSelect Component: Build using shadcn/ui Command + Popover (following design system)
Category Infrastructure: Create complete CRUD following established product patterns
Optimistic Updates: Implement immediate feedback using TanStack Query mutations
Form Integration: Use react-hook-form field integration with proper validation
Normalization: Apply consistent naming patterns like product names
Architecture Decisions:

Use Command component for search/filter functionality
Implement traditional modal patterns (not intercepting routes)
Apply three-layer backend pattern for consistency
Use same optimistic update strategy as products
Follow existing file naming and organization conventions
Step 4 ‚Äî Final Plan Summary
üìÅ Files to be Created/Updated
New Files:

src/lib/data/categories.js - Category CRUD operations
src/lib/api/categories.js - Category API client functions
route.js - Category API endpoints (GET, POST)
src/hooks/use-category-queries.js - Category TanStack Query hooks
src/components/features/products/category-creatable-select.jsx - Main CreatableSelect component
Updated Files:

queryKeys.js - Add category query keys
zod-schemas.js - Add category validation schema
product-creation-form.jsx - Replace categoryId input
product-edit-modal.jsx - Replace categoryId input
üì¶ Key Dependencies & APIs
Existing Dependencies (Already Installed):

@radix-ui/react-popover - For dropdown positioning
@radix-ui/react-command - For search/filter functionality
@tanstack/react-query - For optimistic mutations
react-hook-form - For form field integration
zod - For validation
Key API Properties:

Command - value, onValueChange, filter for search
Popover - open, onOpenChange for dropdown control
useMutation - onMutate, onSuccess, onError for optimistic updates
Controller - For react-hook-form integration
üîÑ Reused Components & Logic
From Existing Codebase:

products.js patterns ‚Üí /src/lib/data/categories.js
use-product-queries.js optimistic patterns ‚Üí /src/hooks/use-category-queries.js
utils.js normalizeProductName ‚Üí normalizeCategoryName
/src/components/ui/command.jsx and /src/components/ui/popover.jsx - shadcn/ui components
Three-layer API pattern from products implementation
Import Paths:
import { Command, CommandInput, CommandList, CommandItem } from "@/components/ui/command"
import { Popover, PopoverContent, PopoverTrigger } from "@/components/ui/popover"
import { useMutation, useQuery, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import { Controller } from "react-hook-form"

‚è≥ Ready for Implementation
Implementation Order:

Backend Infrastructure (Data layer, API routes, Zod schemas)
TanStack Query hooks with optimistic updates
CreatableSelect component with Command + Popover
Integration into product forms
Testing and error handling
